**Team Name:** CODECOMMANDERS  
**Deployed Link:** [Smart Crisis Manager](https://smartcrisismanager-production.up.railway.app/)  
**Repository:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/khyatig0206/smartCrisis_manager.git)

## 📖 Overview

Emergencies like accidents, medical crises, or panic attacks often leave people **frozen, confused, or unable to act quickly**. Currently, users must juggle multiple actions:
- Calling emergency numbers
- Informing family
- Finding the nearest hospital  
All while under **extreme stress**.

### ❗ The Problem
- Manual steps. Stress delays. Poor coordination.
- No app lets you **trigger multiple life-saving actions at once**.

### ✅ Our Solution
**Smart Crisis Manager** – an **AI-powered emergency assistant** that automates life-saving tasks during crises.

## 🔑 Features
- ⚡ **One-tap or voice-activated trigger**
- 🧠 **Understands emergencies in natural language**
- 🚨 **Detects severity of the situation using AI**
- 📲 **Instantly alerts family & friends**
- 🏥 **Finds nearest hospitals or emergency centers**
- 📅 **Books appointments or calls ambulances automatically**
- 📍 **Shares real-time GPS location with responders**

## ⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ **Trigger** → Text / Voice / Gesture (e.g., “Help me!”, or double-press key)  
2️⃣ **Intent Detection** → AI analyzes urgency *(Planned: LangGraph)*  
3️⃣ **Agent Coordination** → Divide tasks (Alert family, locate hospital, book appointment)  
4️⃣ **Execution** → Calls, texts, directions, booking *(Planned: OmniDimension)*
